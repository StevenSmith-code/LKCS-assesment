# LKCS-assesment
This project was for applying to LKCS as a frontend developer. Made this with using only html and css.
My workflow while working on this assesment was as follows:

Resources used: HTML5, CSS, FontAwesomeIcons, IK-CS website.
websites referenced: https://codepen.io/enbee81/full/yLyrmyg

1/30: Started decoding the JPEG of the website and categorizing it into groups of divs so I can determine the best way to style the website. Then I started on the header portion which took around ~2 hours to nail the styling and to also get the logo from the LK-CS website.

1/31-2/2: Looked online to see how to replicate the diagonal layout and translate it into react but unfortunatly you can't really layer components using z-index's like you can with div's so I had to scratch the react project and start over using basic HTML and CSS. Started looking up ways to recreate the "diagonal effect" on the website and a common pattern is using the skew css element to skew the background in a way such that it creates the diagonal slant. after that I mostly searched for photos that resembled ones shown on the design draft. It took about ~8-9 hours to redesign the website from react to html but it's definitly manageable and easier to do the diagonal layout.

2/3: I finished the website, it took around 5-6 hours to nail down the styling and trying to clone as much as I could from the JPEG sent to me. Although I do have questions concerning all of the images I had to gather off of google and the copyright issues that it may present. Total time spent on the assignment is about 10-12 hours. Tomorrow I'll work on the responsive aspect and add in some javascript elements.

2/4: I finished up the responsive aspect of the website and added a dropdown menu in for the navigation links in the header. finishing up some small details and I'll be finished. Total hours taken to complete: ~14 hours.
